Welcome to the ETA Administration Page!
<BR>
<BR>
The purpose of this page is to provide a reference and help notes.  It 
is intended to grow as the system is maintained, and each administrator 
to add their own input.

<A name=history><STRONG>History:</STRONG> </A><STRONG>
<BR></STRONG>This system started out in MS Access 97 in 1999. 
The system grew very large, and problems plauged the system. The developer 
(Tom George from TIEM Design Engineering) 
left TIEM before  it was finished. It was upgraded  to MS Access 2000 
in 2001 by Magnalinea.
<BR>
<BR>
In 2001, 
"Phase 1" of the 
present form was put in place by 
Magnalinea.   It is comprised of one web server and one database server.  
  Stability was the main reason for change to web format.  The lightweight 
web user interface was an added benefit to reduce network traffic and application 
speed.  This phase is the core function of packages.
<BR>
<BR>
In 2002, "Phase 2" was started to add ECI functionality, reports, Scheduling functions,
 and various improvements.
<BR>
<BR>
System developed by: <BR>Kurt 
LaCourt&nbsp;<BR> Magnalinea Corporation <BR>941 25th street<BR>Columbus, 
IN<BR>
          (812) 376-8977  
       
<BR>
<BR>
<A name=testPackage><STRONG>Test 
Package:</STRONG> </A><STRONG>
<BR></STRONG>
The test package 
in this system is "XXX0". It has full functionality and is littered with ECIs, 
etc.
          
        
<BR>
<BR>
<A name=database><STRONG>Database:</STRONG></A><STRONG>
<BR></STRONG>
Microsoft SQL server 2005 Enterprise edition.
<BR><BR>
System is broken into three parts (databases): ETA, 
EmployeeData, and ECI.&nbsp; Transactions are used to ensure data integrity.

<BR>
<BR>
<A name=asp><STRONG>ASP:</STRONG></A><STRONG>
<BR></STRONG>
Majority is site is written on *.asp pages.  As a general rule, VBScript is 
used for server side actions, and jscript is used for client side actions.  The
exception is where date calculations or configured message boxes are used - these
are not available in jscript at time of authorship.  VBScript is used for client
side action in these cases.


<BR>
<BR>
<A name=permissions><STRONG>Permissions:</STRONG></A><STRONG>
<BR></STRONG>
Permissions are granted in the wwwroot folder (colweb01 - C:\Intetpub\tiem\eta
wwwroot).  IIS manages permissions based on windows login.


<BR>
<BR>
<A name=security><STRONG>Security:</STRONG></A><STRONG>
<BR></STRONG>Security is handled by IIS also. Current configuration is suitable 
for Intranet, but not Internet. HTTPS: must be enabled before this is to be 
considered for Internet access. 


<BR>
<BR>
<A name=webSqlConnection><STRONG>Web Server/SQL Server Communication:</STRONG></A><STRONG>
<BR></STRONG>ODBC is used for communications between the webserver and Database.  The 
ODBC resides on the webserver as a System DSN, uses TCP/IP (NOT NAMED PIPES), and SQL authentication.  
The user account resides on the SQL server, and is User "ETA" and password "ETA".  
It has "dbOwner" permissions to allow all the functions of the system.  Each web page 
has the provider string with UID and PWD in the server side script.  This is needed 
since the UID and PWD in the System DSN is usually ignored (microsoft known bug).


<BR>
<BR>
<A name=DataMaintenance><STRONG>Data Maintenance:</STRONG></A>
<BR>
The goal of the ETA system is to be self-maintaining everywhere possible.  Functions are provided to
allow users (DE) to make changes to the data as needed.  It is better to provide users with a 
proper means to make changes than to tempt hacking to get desired results.  
<BR>
<BR>In the infancy 
of this project, Dave Moore (Design Engineer) was given permissions to perform data cleaning.  
This also required Enterprise Manager to be installed on his PC.  The frequency of erroneous data 
requiring cleanup dwindled to approximately one per month.  Upon Dave Moore's departure, no 
replacement was selected.
<BR>
<BR>
Most of the data modification functions are located in the "Engineering Toolbox", where most of 
the ETA work is done.  The administration level tools are located in the "Package Administration" 
section.  There is a link in the Package Administration navigation frame called "Data Admin".  This 
is where odd but necessary data tools are located.


<BR>
<BR>
<A name=Images><STRONG>Images:</STRONG></A>
<BR>
There are several groupings of images used in this system:
<BR>
<BR>
PDF:
<BR>
These are only for ISO required documents.  The intention is to have a paperless system.  These 
are the biggest maintenance point for this system, which is otherwise user maintainied.  Whenever 
the documents are changed, they must be re-created in Adobe Acrobat, with all the field names 
correct for interface with PdfGenerator.asp.  New fields must be added to PdfGenerator.asp if they 
are to be populated with data from the database.
<BR>
<BR>
GIF:
<BR>
These are used primarily on webpages in HTML code for effect and instruction.
<BR>
<BR>
JPG:
<BR>
These are usually photographs used to show details, such as for ECI explanations.
<BR>
<BR>
NOTES:
<BR>
In the ECI section, there are two sets of Revision symbols (RevA.gif, RevA.jpg, etc.).  This is 
needed for PDF rendering.  The gif images are used in the web pages, and the jpg images are larger 
and are used for creating PDFs.  The PDFs do not work well with the smaller images, and appear 
pixelated on screen and when printed out.  It was hard to read, so the larger jpg images are used 
to correct this behavior.
